Report Summary

---

1. r1_instructor_sections_class_average

Shows you every course section taught by each instructor for each semester. For each section, you see which instructor taught it, the course and section details, and the average class grade (using a number scale converted from letter grades). You’ll quickly spot sections or instructors with high or low class averages.

---

2. r2_student_at_risk

Breaks down, by program, how many students are flagged (meaning expelled, suspended, or on academic probation), and the total number of students in that program. It also gives you the percentage at risk. Makes it easy to see which credentials or schools have the most students in trouble.

---

3. r3_list_students_by_inputted_course

Lets you input a course code and see everyone registered in that course. You get the list of students and what semester they’re taking it. Good for quickly checking who’s taking a specific class.

---

4. r4_high_performing_students

Finds students who are beating the average for their program. For each, you get their average, their program’s average, and how much better they’re doing as a percent. This is handy for finding honor students or people who might deserve a scholarship.

Each report folder includes a script, an output file showing the results, and a short README on how to run it. Outputs show exactly what you’d see if you ran these in Oracle SQL*Plus.
